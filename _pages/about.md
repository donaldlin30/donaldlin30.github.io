I am a Ph.D student in the Computer Science & Engineering at the University of Michigan. My research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning and healthcare.

In May 2024, I graduated from [Davidson College](https://www.davidson.edu/) with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Mathematics. I was advised by [Dr. Raghuram Ramanujan](https://www.davidson.edu/people/raghu-ramanujan) and [Dr. Yan Zhuang](https://yanzhuang.name/).
