My research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning and healthcare. I am a member of the Machine Learning for Data-Driven Decisions ([MLD3](https://wiens-group.engin.umich.edu/)) research group under the [Michigan AI Lab](https://ai.engin.umich.edu/). I am fortunate to be co-advised by Prof. [Jenna Wiens](https://public.websites.umich.edu/~wiensj/) and Prof. [Maggie Makar](https://mymakar.github.io/).

Before UMich, I graduated from [Davidson College](https://www.davidson.edu/) with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Mathematics. I was advised by Prof. [Raghu Ramanujan](https://www.davidson.edu/people/raghu-ramanujan) and Prof. [Yan Zhuang](https://yanzhuang.name/). At Davidson, I have worked in reinforcement learning and decision-making, and explored applications in nuclear physics and chess. For more details, please refer to the [`projects`](https://donaldlin30.github.io/projects/) section.

Please feel free to [email](mailto:dxinlin@umich.edu) me at `dxinlin [at] umich [dot] edu` for any questions, or just to say hi!
